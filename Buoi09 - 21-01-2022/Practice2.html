        <p><strong>Fox are small to medium-sized, omnivorous mammals belonging to several genera of the family 
            Canidae.</strong>  They have a flattened skull, upright triangular ears, a pointed, slightly upturned snout,
             and a long bushy tail (or brush).</p>
        <p>Twelve species belong to the monophyletic "true foxes" group of genus Vulpes. Approximately another 
            25 current or extinct species are always or sometimes called foxes; these foxes are either part of 
            the paraphyletic group of the South American foxes, or of the outlying group, which consists of 
            the bat-eared fox, gray fox, and island fox.[1]</p>
        <p>Foxes live on every continent except Antarctica. The most common and widespread species of fox is 
            the red fox (Vulpes vulpes) with about 47 recognized subspecies.[2] The global distribution of 
            foxes, together with their widespread reputation for cunning, has contributed to their prominence 
            in popular culture and folklore in many societies around the world. The hunting of foxes with 
            packs of hounds, long an established pursuit in Europe, especially in the British Isles, 
            was exported by European settlers to various parts of the New World.</p>
